# Perfecto Calligraphy Font

To use the "Perfecto Calligraphy" font in this project:

1. Download the font file from a reputable source (e.g., Creative Fabrica, Exfont)
2. Place the font file(s) in this directory (`public/fonts/`)
3. Name the files as:
   - `PerfectoCalligraphy.woff2` (preferred)
   - `PerfectoCalligraphy.woff` (fallback)
   - `PerfectoCalligraphy.ttf` (fallback)

The font is already configured in `app/globals.css` and will automatically load once the font files are placed here.
